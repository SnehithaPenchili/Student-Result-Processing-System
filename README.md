# Student-Result-Processing-System
This project implements a Student Result Processing System in C.
The program reads student details from a file, validates the data, computes results, assigns grades and CGPA, and finally displays a detailed tabular report along with class statistics.

The system is designed using modular programming, structures, and file handling, as required in academic coursework.
